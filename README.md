# RISC-V_Processor

For this project I engaged in a lab project focused on building a RISC-V-like single-cycle processor using a Xilinx FPGA, gaining practical experience in digital logic, computer architecture, and assembly language. 

To construct the processor, I delved into the fundamentals of digital logic, starting with basic logic gates and advancing to complex digital logic circuits. I also learned about computer architecture and the essentials of an instruction set, utilizing an assembler to convert assembly code into machine code. Running machine code programs on the processor served as a means to verify its functionality.

Throughout the project, I worked on three primary components of digital processor circuits: the interface for user interaction, the datapath consisting of data manipulation and storage circuits connected by wires, and the control path responsible for directing the datapath based on the current function to be executed. By employing SystemVerilog, an industry-standard HDL, I programmed and tested digital logic circuits on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA using the TUL PYNQ Z2 platform. The development process involved simulating the SystemVerilog code with the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite before implementing it on the FPGA.

Through this hands-on project, I acquired valuable expertise in programming and testing digital logic circuits, utilizing FPGA technology, and employing SystemVerilog as a hardware description language. The successful implementation of a RISC-V-like single-cycle processor on the Xilinx FPGA demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical hardware design.

This project was done as a part of the lab section for EECE2322 Fundamentals of Digital Design and Computer Organization.
